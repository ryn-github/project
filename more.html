      Hi there! My name is Michael grover, and I am an explorer. Ever since I've been little, I've loved searching for new things. As a baby, my parents kept finding me in nooks and crannies around the house, "on the search" as they would say. By the age of 5, I had been to every continent on the planet, barring Antarctica. For my 12th birthday, my parents got me diving lessons, by the time I was 13 I could scuba dive to a depth of 40 meters, as well as go cave diving. I got a pilots license at the age of 17, and learned to sail before my 18th birthday. Instead of going to university, I decided to travel around South America, exploring its rich jungles and beautiful landscapes. During my trip, I met my now wife, who was also an explorer. For our honeymoon, we sailed around the Caribbean, where we discovered 3 new islands, which we named after the cats I had growing up. Over the course of my life, I have come across great treasures and wondrous experience, but, in all my life, and all my travels, I'm afraid I have never come across a single person who asked for your opinion.
